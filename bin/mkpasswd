"""Generate a random, memorizable password: http://xkcd.com/936/

Example run:

    kragen at inexorable:~/devel/inexorable-misc$ ./mkpass.py 5 12
    Your password is "learned damage saved residential stages".
    That's equivalent to a 60-bit key.

    That password would take 2.5e+03 CPU-years to crack
    on my inexpensive Celeron E1200 from 2008,
    assuming an offline attack on a MS-Cache hash,
    which is the worst password hashing algorithm in common use,
    slightly worse than even simple MD5.

    The most common password-hashing algorithm these days is FreeBSD’s
    iterated MD5; cracking such a hash would take 5.2e+06 CPU-years.

    But a modern GPU can crack about 250 times as fast,
    so that same iterated MD5 would fall in 2e+04 GPU-years.

    That GPU costs about US$1.45 per day to run in 2011,
    so cracking the password would cost about US$3e+09.

I've started using a password generated this way in place of a 9-printable-
ASCII-character random password, which is equally strong.  Munroe's assertion
that these passwords are much easier to memorize is correct.  However, there is
still a problem: because there are many fewer bits of entropy per character
(about 1.7 instead of 6.6) there is a lot of redundancy in the password, and so
attacks such as the ssh timing-channel attack (the Song, Wagner, and Tian
Herbivore attack, which I learned about from Bram Cohen in the Bagdad Café in
the wee hours one morning, years ago) and keyboard audio recording attacks have
a much better chance of capturing enough information to make the password
attackable.

My countermeasure to the Herbivore attack, which works well with 9-character
password but is extremely annoying with my new password, is to type the
password with a half-second delay between characters, so that the timing
channel does not carry much information about the actual characters used.
Additionally, the lower length of the 9-character password inherently gives the
Herbivore approach much less information to chew on.

Other possible countermeasures include using Emacs shell-mode, which prompts
you locally for the password when it recognizes a password prompt and then
sends the whole password at once, and copying and pasting the password from
somewhere else.

As you'd expect, this password also takes a little while longer to type: about
6 seconds instead of about 3 seconds.
